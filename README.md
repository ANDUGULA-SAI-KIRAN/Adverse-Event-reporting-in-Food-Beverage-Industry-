The dataset from the Centre for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition(CFSAN) Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS) is a comprehensive collection of reports submitted to the Food and Drug Adminitration(FDA) regarding adverse events and product complaints associated with foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. It spans from 2004 to the second quarter of 2017 and includes several key fields

## **Project Description**

The CAERS database serves as a critical tool for the FDA, housing adverse event and product complaint reports pertaining to foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. This dataset spans from 2004 to the second quarter of 2017, encompassing detailed records of various products and their associated adverse events. Each record undergoes meticulous coding using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology, ensuring standardized reporting across diverse products. The dataset includes crucial elements such as report numbers, product roles, brand names, industry codes, patient demographics, adverse outcomes, and coded symptoms.

## **Project Objective**

The primary objective of analyzing the CFSAN Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS) dataset is to attain a comprehensive understanding of adverse events linked with foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics as reported to the FDA. This analysis aims to identify patterns and trends within these events, encompassing their distribution across various product categories, the demographic characteristics of affected individuals, and the types and severities of reported symptoms and outcomes. By delving into these aspects, the analysis endeavors to provide valuable insights for bolstering product safety surveillance, informing regulatory policies, and ultimately enhancing public health outcomes by pinpointing potential risks and areas for intervention within the food, dietary supplement, and cosmetics industries.

## **Project Overview**

The visualization project delves into the adverse effects experienced by consumers after using nutritional products and cosmetics. By examining reported symptoms and their outcomes, the analysis aims to uncover patterns and trends across different age and gender categories. Through this exploration, the project seeks to provide valuable insights into product safety and consumer health, aiding regulatory bodies and industries in enhancing product quality and ensuring consumer well-being.
